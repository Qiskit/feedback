# Qiskit public feedback discussions

This repository is a central place for the community to keep up with the development of Qiskit and provide feedback on all aspects of the SDK. This repository currently has 2 main parts, and may expand in future:

## [📄 Wiki](https://github.com/qiskit-community/feedback/wiki)
In this tab you can find useful information about upcoming releases, as well as the agenda and recordings of our fortnightly DemoDays

## [🗣 Discussions](https://github.com/qiskit-community/feedback/discussions)
These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the Qiskit products could be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the core Qiskit teams. Check out [Making Suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide productive feedback.

You can also use this space to continue conversations about our fortnightly DemoDays, and even volunteer to participate in future ones!

This feedback process is heavily influenced by the official public feedback discussions process used by GitHub and npm. Thank you to the teams who worked on that for paving the path!

### 💡 Making Suggestions
We encourage you to open a discussion if you have suggestions for how we can improve Qiskit. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out the [Welcome to Qiskit Discussions](https://github.com/qiskit-community/feedback/discussions/1) section if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion reply with additional details or react to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

Please remember to always be kind and respectful to your fellow Qiskitters, you can read our Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
